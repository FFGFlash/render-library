## Todo

- [x] Implement signals.
- [x] Implement effects.
- [x] Implement computed signals.
- [x] Implement basic rendering pipeline.
- [x] Track mounted signals/computed signals/effects during rendering for cleanup.
- [ ] Lazy loading components would be nice.
- [ ] Suspense would be nice, computed signals can currently be asynchronous, but return null until resolved, would be nice to have it suspend the render instead until it's resolved.
